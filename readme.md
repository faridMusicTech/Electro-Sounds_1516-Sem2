# Readme

This semester, it will be about generating images using code and algorithms. I will create my own generative systems with the means of a range of coding techniques and good ideas. 

## Generative Art

Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.

## My Goal

My goal in this project is to produce a gradual learning curve about learning, understanding and writing a type of language code with the use of a software-based program called "Processing", and to produce wonderful generative art/visuals. Through the leaning and studying of codes, I will be producing four different kinds of assignments, and for the final assignment, it will be the best out of the four, instilling most of the different techniques and algorithms that I've learnt. I will also be documenting all of my asignments through my personal blog.
