# Generative Art Project Reflection

My choice of an interesting concept of Generative Art would be ‘Conical’, done by Marius Watz. His projects consist of
vivid colors, with outputs ranging from pure software works to public
hard-edged geometrical forms and
projections and physical objects produced with digital fabrication technology.
Marius’s work focuses mainly on the synthesis of form as the product of
parametric behaviors. The aesthetics found in this ‘Conical’ project were
intriguingly apparent and pleased to look at and it was those combinations of
distinctive shapes and sizes. The colors chosen by Marius for this project were
perfectly blended as well. The positions of the various objects, shapes and
structures were well thought of and decided. I was also amazed at his parametric
way of constructing his projects. He builds upon different parameters while
making creative and confident decisions. The shapes that Marius decides for
each of his projects match the style that he was going for. Overall, his unique
style really fascinated me each time I came across his works.

## How the Project Works Technically

The ‘Conical’ project done by Marius Watz was designed to look like a
tornado. I noticed that it is made up of rectangles, which varies in size. The
rectangles are being superimposed onto one another to create that layering
effect which also blends the colors together. The colors used are blue, yellow and
white and to me they give a warm, modern, techy kind of feel to the project. The
sharpness of the end of the rectangles with different colors, which are being
layered over other rectangles, also affects the pattern, which will then produce
irregular shapes. I have also noticed that the cone-shaped figure revolves around
a point or a pixel. To me, it gives somehow like a ‘black-hole’ effect if it was
animating. Then, the angle of view was being shifted to give audience the whole
asthetic view of the project. I really like the concept of something or everything
being initialized from just a point of reference because metaphorically speaking,
sometimes in life, we tend to always look back at where or how we started.
