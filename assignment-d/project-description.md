# Project Description 

   Firstly, I planned on figuring out the shapes that I needed before I start to animate anything. Hence, I used 'ellipses', 'rectangles', 'boxes', 'spheres' and 'bezier' lines for this assignment. 
   
   Secondly, I planned on breaking number of classes into parts. I chose to work on one class at a time before going to the next class, as to not confuse myself, on creating the animations/scenes/story. 
   
**My Classes:**

- rotatingBox
- flyingRect
- whirlPool
- cocoon
- statics
- butterfly

Thirdly, after completing all the classes of animations, I decided on the number of scenes I was planning to use and how I could play them as a 'keyPressed' function. For that, I used the 'bitwise operator' method together with the 'keyPressed' function. 

**Techniques Used:**

- class
- ArrayList
- Rotate
- scale
- noise
- map
- sphereDetail
- push/popMatrix
- keyPressed(switch)
- bitwise operator
- minim
- syphon

Fourthly, I made an original soundtrack in Ableton Live which goes along together with my sketch animation. Next, I played my soundtrack while running my processing sketch so that the minim input could detect the dynamics of my soundtrack and react accordingly to the values that i had set. But before everything, I have imported the 'syphon' library into my sketch so that it could mirror the live video into the syphon program whenever I run it. After recording through syphon, I exported the file as MP4 format.

Fifthly, I imported the video file that I've recorded from syphon and my soundtrack into iMovie and repositioned so they will look and sound in sync. After which, I export and compressed the final file titled "Evoution, Extinction" before uploading it to 'Vimeo'.
